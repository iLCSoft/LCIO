# v02-14

* 2020-07-01 Frank Gaede ([PR#86](https://github.com/ilcsoft/lcio/pull/86))
  - new classes  `UTIL::EventSummary` and `UTIL::ProcessFlag`
          - used in delphes2lcio for writing event summary information and 
             encoding the generated Monte Carlo process 
  - improve delphes2lcio example
       - fill more quantities for EventSummary ( see  UTIL::EventSummary )
       - updated examples

* 2020-07-01 Remi Ete ([PR#85](https://github.com/ilcsoft/lcio/pull/85))
  - Fixed LCGenericObject collection flag IO writing
  - Fixed virtual override warning in SIOReader

* 2020-06-30 Ete Remi ([PR#79](https://github.com/ilcsoft/lcio/pull/79))
  - Externalized SIO package: https://github.com/iLCSoft/SIO
  - Use new SIO implementation:
    - Ensure thread-safety for multiple LCReader / LCWriter instance (removal of globals)
    - Possibility for adding new compression algorithm in future
    - Standard LCReader and LCWriter use the MT versions (see below) for implementation under the hood
  - Added new `MT::LCReader` and `MT::LCWriter`
     - Different interface for reading and writing events. Use smart pointers for event/run ownership
     - MT::LCWriter allows for writing concurrently event in a file from multiple threads. Event encoding and compression is standalone, so thread-safe, and I/O writing is done under a (fast) mutex.
  - Introduce new creation flag for standard LCReader: **LazyUnpacking**
     1. Reads an event from file 
     2. Move the compressed buffer inside an LCEvent object
     3. Perform un-compression and decoding only on demand when `LCEvent::getCollection()` is called
  - LCIO objects uids increment is now atomic (`AccessChecked`)
  - Introduced runtime extensions for LCEvent, accessible via `LCEvent::runtime()` method.
  - Introduced `LCIO_DEPRECATED` macro for deprecated methods in LCIODeprecated.h
  - LCIO extensions:
    - Removed global destructor mapping for each relation type, because not thread safe
    - Turned internal extension type to `std::shared_ptr<void>` to use type-safe extension destructor
  - Added example binaries:
     - `lcio_parallel_processing`: a small example to illustrates how to use the new MT classes. Implements a simple scheduling algorithm for parallel event processing
     - `lcio_parallel_read`: a small example of how to dump events and runs from multiple files at the same time in parallel
     - `lcio_performance`: printout file reading performance with and without lazy unpacking
  - Unit testing:
     - added unit test for lazy unpacking feature
     - switched back ON the unit test on RT extensions
  - Bug fixes
     - CXX standard was hardcoded to 14. Now set it to 14 if not specified via command line with i.e `-DCMAKE_CXX_STANDARD=17`  
  - Packaged builtin SIO in LCIO
     - Compile the SIO library (only) if not found on your system

* 2020-06-25 Frank Gaede ([PR#84](https://github.com/ilcsoft/lcio/pull/84))
  - improve the delphes2lcio tool

       - the default configuration works for the ILD delphes card [https://github.com/ILDAnaSoft/ILDDelphes](https://github.com/ILDAnaSoft/ILDDelphes)
       - it can be overwritten with a simple configuration file see ./examples/delphes2lcio.cfg and *Advanced Topics* in the README.md
       - additional jet collections can be added to the event if available in the delphes output
               - current default are *Durham2Jets-Durham6Jets*

    Note: in the previous release (v02-05) the versions for libraries and 
          documentation had not been updated and all showed v02-04-03,
          even though it had been tagged as v02-05. As this has been fixed
          now, a rebuid is necessary when installing this patch release.


# v02-05

	- Several changes by J. McCormick on the JAVA side:
		Work on LCIO-31 and LCIO-32.
		Fix for LCIO-30 by updating freehep-sio version.
		Updated the build system

	- Fixed setPositionVec (different types of hits in calo and tracker) - C. Grefe
	- Added proper handling of exceptions. Whenever an LCIO C++ exception is thrown, the corresponding python exception is raised instead - C. Grefe
	- Fixed a bug in getNumberOfEvents (spotted by Eduard) - C. Grefe	

	- write udrup parameter also when it is 0
      - turned LCIO_GENERATE_HEADERS off ( generation of headers with java is broken )


# v02-04-03

	- Added a statement about the minimum python version to use

	- Adapted the example to the changed interface in EventLoop.



# v02-04-02

     - add template std::string toString(const T* obj) for
       easy printing w/o operators (e.g. from Python)

     - added missing pragma link statements for Track classes
       (needed for ROOT dictionary/python binding)
     
     - cleanup of Cmake code for BUILD_ROOTDICT
     
     - fixed (again) target dylib2so for APPLE

     - Updated the StdHepReader to use the exact same interface as the LcioReader
       (Ch.Grefe)

# v02-04-01
    - LCReader/SIOReader sets the RunHeader parameter "LCIOFileName" to
      the current file name (usefull if a list of files is processed)

    
    - bug fix in SIOReader:  used to hold pointer to StringVec argument of
      SIOReader::open(StringVec& files) - now the filenames are copied to local
      class member variable 
   
    - added missing const keywords for getValue() and highestBit()
      in UTIL::BitField64  (Ch.Grefe)

# v02-04
  - Ch.Grefe, CERN
    added a new python binding: pyLCIO based on the optional ROOT dictionary
    see: $LCIO/examples/python/README for examples on how to use it

 
  - added new method to limit the collections that are going to be read 
    from a file:
      LCReader::setReadCollectionNames(const std::vector<std::string>& cn)
    - C++ only so far
    - anajob and dumpevent now read variable LCIO_READ_COL_NAMES with
      space separated list of colection names to read only these

  - pointers to LCObjects that are not in the event are now set to NULL
    
  - an Exception is thrown if a null pointer is found in a subset collection
    (e.g. if LCIO_READ_COL_NAMES is set inconsistently such that 
     the collection(s) holding the elements is not read )

    - this behavior can be deactivated with setting the environment variable
      LCIO_IGNORE_NULL_IN_SUBSET_COLLECTIONS=1
      if really needed, e.g. to read inconsistent or corrupt files

  - added build option for C++ only builds
    using pre-genetarated header files:
     cmake -DLCIO_GENERATE_HEADERS=OFF ..

    - note: header files will have to be updated manually by developers
      after changing the class layout

  - some minor fixes:
    - fix missing include issue in UTIL/LCIterator.h for latest ubuntu
    - update freehep-sio dep to 2.3
    - enforce cmake version >= 2.8



# v02-03-03

  - fixed bug in TrackerHitPlaneImpl and TrackerHitZCylinderImpl
    with size of covariance matrix being 0 (no set to 6)
    that caused corrupted LCIO files when any hits of these types
    where written as "TrackerHit" types, e.g. in a new subset collection
    that is made persistent ...
    this is no problem for the DBD standard reconstruction !

     MCParticle::BITOverlay=23 and methods
     MCParticle::isOverlay() 
     MCParticle::setOverlay(bool v)
     - print as 'o' in LCTOOLS/Operators
  
   -  added new methods (in C++)
       LCReader::getRuns(EVENT::IntVec & runs)  and
        LCReader::getEvents(EVENT::IntVec & events) 
      that return the run and event numbers in a given file
      - to be used in randomly reading events for bg overlay
      - implemented in SIOReader
      - minimal testing in test_randomaccess.cc
 
   - in Operators.cc:
     - print covariance matrix as lower triangle matrix for Track and TrackState
     - added GoodnessOfPID to dumpe of ReconstructedParticle

   - changed the gnu jel dependency in pom.xml to 2.0.1 from 0.9
     plus small change in SIODump.java

     ROOT-OGL and writes ascii file

   - made UTIL::LCIterator<T> compatibel with gcc 4.3.2
     (#include <typeinfo>, reported by M.Killenberg)
   

# v02-02
    - added new class LCIterator<T> for convenient loops over collections, e.g.:

        for(  LCIterator<Track> it( evt, "Tracks" ) ;  Track* trk = it.next()  ; ) {
   
           std::cout << trk->getTrackState( TrackState::AtIP ) << std::endl  ;
        }

# v02-00
    
    - added multiple trackstates for Track
        
        - Original functions getX() of Track will return: trk.getTrackStates()[0].getX()
        
        - TrackState::getLocation() returns one of the predefined locations:
            AtOther = 0 ; // any location other than the ones defined below         
            AtIP = 1 ;
            AtFirstHit = 2 ;
            AtLastHit = 3 ;
            AtCalorimeter = 4 ;

            LastLocation = AtVertex  ;

        - TrackState* getTrackState(int location)
            returns the trackstate at the given location, where location is given by one
            of the predefined locations specified above
        
        - TrackState* getClosestTrackState(float x, float y, float z)

   (constants LCIO::WRITE_NEW and LCIO::WRITE_APPEND )
   C++ only

 - SIO file buffers are flushed after each record
   
 - small program 'copyfix' added:
   Copies all complete events from a file (that has incomplete  
   records at the end due to a program crash) so the append mechanism can be used 
   to continue the program after the crash, e.g. a long running simulation job.

   given event ( demonstrating fast skip mechanism - no direct access)
   -> see example dumpevent.cc

 - duplicate event header information is not written any more (neither Java nor C++)
   -> event information always in two consecutive records of sio file:
      LCEventHeader: runNum, evtNum, collection names and types
      LCEvent: the data (collections)

 - compression of files now controled by constants 
   (SLCIO::compression, SIOFactory.compression) - set to true for C++ and Java
  
 - the ant target cpp needs aid.generate as a prerequisite (not automatically 
   included any more)

 - added this file: please document your (major) changes to LCIO here 




# v00-03  (fg 20030509)

 - no 0's at end of strings

 - flag bits for CalorimeterHits taken into account (also Java version)

 - Java version uses identical block names to C++ (as defined in lcio.xml)

 - small bug fix in Java version of SIO:
   src/java/hep/lcd/io/sio/SIOWriter.java writes record header length (as
   opposed to the record length)
   for this to take effect lcio.jar has to be before sio.jar in your
   classpath - otherwise C++ won't be able to read files generated from
   Java...
   needs to be checked for implications on hep.lcd and (if none) applied 
   to sio.jar

 - Java writes the (duplicate) header also for the event record

 - Old files cannot be read with this version !

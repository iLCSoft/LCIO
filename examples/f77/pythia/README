==========================================================================
This directory contains additional examples for the Fortran interface to LCIO

Pythia is required to build and run these examples.

There are also 2 scripts to support the programs
of this directory.

pythiahepevt.sh:
a bourne shell script to run a PYTHIA job that creates
an output file 'pythia.data' using lcwrite and a lof file 'pythiahepevt.log'
which lists the common HEPEVT content of generated events.
Remarks:
lcwrite is modified to include charge information of the generated
MC particles but the output structure is still consistent with
the "standard" lcwrite routine.
pythiahepevt.sh requires the cernlib 2002 or newer given by the environment
variable CERN_ROOT (default: /cern/pro)

   *  @brief  LCWriter class.
   *          Implement a writer for events and run headers using SIO.
   *          Thread safety specifications:
   *          - Writing two events from different threads is safe
   *          - Writing an event and a run header from different threads is safe
   *          - Opening/closing a file and writing might throw an exception depending on the scheduling
   *          A mutex ensures that no data race will occur but won't protect
   *          against race conditions
